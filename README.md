<h1> Wine Quality Prediction </h1>
<p> Using Kaggle’s Red Wine Quality dataset, this project is meant to build classifications models to predict is a red wine "good quality" or not. </p>
<p> This project gives binary output 1 (if the wine has a score of 7 or higher) as a good quality and 0 (if the wine has a score lower than 7)  </p>

Residual sugar<br>
Chlorides<br>
Free sulfur dioxide<br>
Total sulfur dioxide<br>
Density<br>

Alcohol<br>
</p>


<p> the objectif is to to experiment with different classification methods to see which yields the highest accuracy  </p>
