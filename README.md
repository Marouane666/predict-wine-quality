<h1> Wine Quality Prediction </h1>
<p> Using Kaggleâ€™s Red Wine Quality dataset, this project is meant to build classifications models to predict is a red wine "good quality" or not. </p>
<p> This project gives binary output 1 (if the wine has a score of 7 or higher) as a good quality and 0 (if the wine has a score lower than 7)  </p>
